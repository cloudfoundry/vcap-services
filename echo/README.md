cf-echo-service
===============

A new "echo service" which could be added to cloudfoundry. Almost all the codes are inherited from Senthil Vaiyapuri's guide on how to add service in his blog: http://support.cloudfoundry.com/entries/20485171-how-to-add-a-system-service-to-cloud-foundry-step-by-step-guide . However, the code is out of date to deploy on the up-to-date cf code.So I modified it make it run in the latest cf.
