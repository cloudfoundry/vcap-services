Summary
-------
VSCT is short for vcap-service certification tool. It integrates to original vmc tool, meaning that it has full functionalities of vmc. And meanwhile, it provides extra feature for certification.

Installation
-------
Check out the code and vcap-services's submodule. Then it's good to go. The startup script is under <VSCT_HOME>/bin. As it is a extended version of vmc, it can be a replacement for original vmc tool. To do so, just insert <VSCT_HOME>/bin into PATH
    export PATH=<VSCT_HOME>/bin:$PATH

Usage
-------
Check "vmc help", you will find all original vmc commands and two more commands for certification.

create-test <appname>
will push a canonical application to current vmc target and create a set of services(currently, it includes mysql,mongodb,redis and rabbitmq.) and bind those services to the application. Then start the application.

verify-test <appname>
will try to access those services via the canonical application.

Note: These commands depend on vmc target & login. So the target should be set before these commands. And the logined user should be authorized to access rabbitmq service
