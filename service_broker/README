Cloud Foundry Service Broker enables consumption of legacy, non-CF services by CF apps using standard Cloud Foundry APIs and bindings.

== Enable service broker in vcap_dev_setup & vcap_dev

By default, vcap_dev_setup will install and config service_broker
automatically. Nevertheless, service_broker is not in the control list of
vcap_dev, that is to say, "vcap_dev start" will not start service_broker
by default.

So, to enable service_broker in vcap_dev, we need to hack source code. In
vcap_components.rb, modify DEFAULT_CLOUD_FOUNDRY_EXCLUDED_COMPONENT, remove
"service_broker" substring.
