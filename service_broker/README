Cloud Foundry Service Broker enables consumption of legacy, non-CF services by CF apps using standard Cloud Foundry APIs and bindings.

== Enable service broker in vcap_dev_setup & vcap_dev

To enable the service broker in vcap_dev_setup, edit the .../cloudfoundry/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/devbox.yml file 
(or whatever deployment file you are using) and add service_broker to the list of jobs:

---
deployment:
  name: "devbox"

jobs:
  install:
    - nats_server

    ... snip a bunch of other jobs ...

    - service_broker

and then rerun vcap_dev_setup.

To enable the service broker in an already deploy vcap_dev environment, go into 
...cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/config directory do two things:

1.edit the vcap_components.json file adding "service_broker" 
2.drop a service_broker.yml file into that same directory

You can find a sample of the service_broker.yml in the ...cloudfoundry/vcap/services/service_broker/config directory.
Set the values of the token, cloud_controller_uri, mbus, pid and local_db properties appropriately.

This will allow you to start the service broker by executing

vcap_dev start service_broker

or it will be included in the list of components started with a

vcap_dev start
