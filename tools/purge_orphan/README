This tool is used for orphan service instances & bindings related issues. Currently, it can make request to service gateway to check orphans and purge orphans.

To run this tool, it will need a proper profile, which locates to config/ directory. If -c option is not specified, default.yml will be the default profile to run.

Usually, gateway will run check orphan task periodically. But it also can be ordered by this command:
    bin/purge_orphan.rb -k
It will update the orphan statistic in gateway & node. And they will report their current orphan status in varz/healthz.

The report of varz/healthz in json format can be input as the request to purge the orphans. Run command like this:
    bin/purge_orphan.rb sample.json
